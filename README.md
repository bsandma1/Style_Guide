# Personal Style Guide

Codecademy's third full-stack engineer career path challenge project!

Using HTML and some newly learned CSS concepts, I created a personal style guide that I can reference when I work on new projects.  

The 3 sections of the webpage are as follows...

- Color Schemes 
- Font Styles
- Text Styles

The goal of the project was mainly to test what I've learned and get some practice, but to make it worthwhile, I implemented styles that I was actually interested in and that I plan to work with in the future.

Within the filesystem you will find two files:

- HTML file - index.html
- CSS file - index.css
